# workspace and its tests require files from the workspace directory. Or if
# the crate author is simply negligent and didn't ensure the test passes for
# all features. In these cases, you can use this setting to mark the test as
# "flaky" to ignore failures. Special cases for packages.KEY:
# packages."lib+@"      - disables the test for the --all-features autopkgtest

# this for feature A, and feature B depends on feature A, then feature B also
# implicitly has this set. To unset it on feature B (and its transitive rdeps),

# So for example if the test breaks for the bare library (when running with
# --no-default-features) but works when the std feature is enabled, set this to
# true for [packages.lib] and false for [packages."lib+std"].
# Note: debcargo will error if you set these in an inconsistent way. For

# explicitly giving A a value, either true or false.
