- Show `-` option in app protocol picklist only when a filter is active

- Fixed header alignment

## [1.1.2] - 2023-03-18
- Added new translations of the GUI, bringing the total number of supported languages to 8!
  * German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ([#87](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/pull/87))
  * Simplified Chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ([#89](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/pull/89) - [#93](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/pull/93))

  check out issue [#97](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/97) to see all the available hotkeys or to suggest new ones!
- Changed GUI font to `sarasa-gothic-mono` to support the introduction of Simplified Chinese language
- Minor improvements to Overview page proportions and paddings

## [1.1.1] - 2023-02-25
- Added new translations of the GUI!
  * French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ([#64](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/pull/64) - [#67](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/pull/67))
  * Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¦ ([#70](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/pull/70))
  * Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± ([#78](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/pull/78))
- The last successfully sniffed network adapter is now remembered on application closure, so that users don't have to manually select it again when restarting Sniffnet (implementing a feature requested in [#77](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/77))
- Implemented possibility to quit the application pressing crtl+Q keys, as requested in [#68](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/68)
- The last opened settings page is now remembered within a given session
- Fixed bug that caused settings configuration not to be permanently saved across different sessions when closing settings from the 'x' button in the top right corner (fixes [#77](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/77))
- Textual report is now saved in a fixed directory, instead of using the directory where the execution was started. The output is now saved in the same folder containing configuration files storing Sniffnet settings. The directory is automatically chosen by [confy](https://docs.rs/confy/0.5.1/confy/) depending on your architecture, and can be seen hovering on the "Open full report" button. (fixes [#51](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/51))
- When multiple favorite connections are featured per time interval, now it's possible to receive more than one favorite notification referred to the same timestamp
- Fixed problem that was causing the Application Protocol picklist placeholder not being translated

## [1.1.0] - 2023-02-07
- Added Custom Notifications to inform the user when defined network events occur:
  * data intensity exceeded a defined packets per second rate
  * data intensity exceeded a defined bytes per second rate
  * new data are exchanged from one of the favorite connections
- Added Settings pages to configure the state of the application (persistently stored in a configuration file):
  * customise notifications
  * choose between 4 different application styles
  * set the application language (this release introduces the Italian language ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, and more languages will be supported soon)
- Added Geolocation of the remote IP addresses (consult the README for more information)
- Implemented the possibility of marking a group of connections as favorites and added favorites view to the report
- Added modal to ask the user for confirmation before leaving the current analysis
- Added Tooltips to help the user better understand the function of some buttons
- Partially implemented support for broadcast IP addresses (still missing IPv4 directed broadcast)
- The application window is now maximized after start
- All the GUI text fonts have been replaced with 'Inconsolata'
- Fixed issue [#48](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/48) adding a horizontal scrollable to the report view


## [1.0.1] - 2022-11-30
- Substituted command `open` with command `xdg-open` on Linux systems to solve the problem described in issues [#13](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/13) and [#23](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/23)
- Introduced a constraint on minimum window height to avoid problem described in issue [#12](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/12)
- Added some tests on `AppProtocol` and improved GitHub workflows

## [1.0.0] - 2022-11-21
- The application is no longer just a command line interface: Sniffnet has now a whole graphical user interface!
  * Charts and traffic statistics are now constantly updated and shown interactively in the GUI
  * Users don't have to worry about command line options anymore: it is now possible to comfortably specify adapters and filters through the GUI
  * Sniffnet is now more accessible, available in real-time, easy to use and aesthetically pleasing thanks to its new interface
- In order to reach out as many people as possible, I created [installers](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/releases) for Windows, macOS and Linux, to make it easier to install Sniffnet for those that still doesn't have Rust on their machines

- Report header with statistics is now written on a separate textual file (file `statistics.txt`)
- Removed command line option `--verbose` because considered redundant
- Removed command line option `--minimum-packets` because not meaningful anymore

## [0.4.1] - 2022-09-27
- Changed the default textual report representation
- Added command line option `-v` to set the textual report representation to the former one (verbose mode)
