## 👋 Welcome

Sniffnet is an application to empower everyone with a tool to comfortably monitor their Internet traffic.

The main pillar of Sniffnet is to represent in a straightforward way concepts that are usually considered advanced:
for this reason implementing an optimal UI for the application is crucially important.

## 🚀 The Main Product

Sniffnet can be downloaded from [here](https://sniffnet.net/download/).

### Target audience

All users with a decent amount of technological knowledge.

### Design files

> Since I do not have a design team at hand most of the product does not have any Design files, and you'll be forced to browse through the product itself and propose improvements.

## 💅 Design relevant materials

Here is a list of design relevant information and materials:

### Fonts

Sniffnet uses `Sarasa Gothic mono`. The fonts used can be found [here](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/tree/main/resources/fonts).

### Colors and components

For info on the used RGB colors as well as the UI components, I suggest you to give a look at the files in the [styles folder](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/src/gui/styles).

### Logos

You can find a set of logos [here](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/tree/main/resources/logos/raw).
